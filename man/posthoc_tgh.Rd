}
\arguments{
\item{y}{(numeric|formula) Either a numeric vector or formula.}

\item{x}{(factor) a vector that either is a factor or can be converted into
one. If \code{y} is a formula, \code{x} is ignored.}

\item{method}{(\code{"games-howell"}|\code{"tukey"}) Name of post-hoc
tests to conduct. Valid values are "tukey" and "games-howell".}

\item{conf_level}{(number) Confidence level of the confidence intervals. Number from 0 to 1.}

\item{digits}{The number of digits to show in the output.}

\item{p.adjust}{Any valid \code{\link{p.adjust}} method.}

\item{format_pvalue}{Whether to format the p values according to APA
standards (i.e. replace all values lower than .001 with '<.001'). This only
applies to the printing of the object, not to the way the p values are
stored in the object.}

\item{data}{(factor) a data frame with data to be used in combination with formula.}

\item{...}{Further arguments to methods.}

\item{sep}{(character) A string with a symbol to separate group names if several grouping variables are used.}

\item{...}{(further arguments to methods)}
}
\value{
A list of three elements:
\item{input}{List with input arguments}
\item{intermediate}{List of intermediate objects.}
\item{output}{List with
two objects 'tukey' and 'games.howell', containing the outcomes for the
respective post-hoc tests.}
}
\description{
Either Games-Howell test or Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) post-hoc
tests for one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The main part of the
function code and descriptions were
imported from \code{posthocTGH()} in package \pkg{userfriendlyscience}.
}
\note{
This function is based on a file that was once hosted at
\url{http://www.psych.yorku.ca/cribbie/6130/games_howell.R}, but has been removed
since. It was then adjusted for implementation in the
\pkg{userfriendlyscience} package. Jeffrey Baggett needed the
confidence intervals, and so emailed them, after which his updated functions
was used. In the meantime, it appears Aaron Schlegel
(\url{https://rpubs.com/aaronsc32}) independently developed a version with
confidence intervals and posted it on RPubs at
\url{https://rpubs.com/aaronsc32/games-howell-test}.

# Compute post-hoc statistics using the Games-Howell method
