Title: A Collection of Functions for Biostatistics and Biometry Lectures
Description: The package contains a collection of functions dedicated for 
             biostatistics and biometry lectures (GMF1059) that do some common  
             statistical routines without writing to much code. 
             The package is still in its development and some 
             functions are for demonstration purposes only as they may change
             in the future.
