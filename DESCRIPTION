Title: A Collection of Functions for Biostatistics and Biometry Lectures
Description: A collection of functions that either are intended to be used with 
             R Commander plugin `RcmdrPlugin.BioStat` or to do several common 
             statistical routines without writing to much code. 
             The functions are created to complement other R Commander plugins 
             that can be used to teach basic statistics in biostatistics and 
             biometry lectures (GMF1059).
