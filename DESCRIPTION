Title: Routines for Basic (Bio)Statistics (Old Version of Package)
Description: (This is the old version of the package. 
             We recommend uing `biostat` instead). 
             A collection of functions that either are intended to be used with 
             R Commander plugin `RcmdrPlugin.BioStat.old` or to do several common 
             statistical routines (without writing to much code). 
             The functions are created to complement other R Commander plugins 
             that can be used to teach basic statistics especially in 
             biostatistics and biometry lectures.
